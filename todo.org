* MAJOR TASKS:

** TODO Prepare data
*** DONE communication frame
*** DONE communication with the thingspeak through MQTT
*** TODO log system
*** TODO temporary data save

** DONE Extract data from picture

** DONE MQTT - setup on raspberry pi
*** e.g. save configuration data in separate file, which will be ignored by the github!

* MINOR IMPROVEMENTS:
** TODO Monitor system parameters as well (to shutdown raspberry pi in case of emergency)
